This is the final project for CS 290 Web Development. This project is being made
by Devon Crane, Lauren Gastineau, and Symon Ramos.

The purpose of this assignment is to create a website that uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
Node.js, and some server client interactions that stay on the page even after the
user leaves the page.

 Now the topic we are doing is a Wikipedia parody we call Hessipedia. we will create a Wikipedia page on our teacher Rob Hess. It will contain a main page, an article on Rob Hess, and
 any other information that may be connected to the topic. this website's articles
 will be editable, to where users can change any facts or sentences in the article just 
 like Wikipedia.
