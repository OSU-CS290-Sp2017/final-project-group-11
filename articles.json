    "content": "Dr. Hess originates from 'America's coolest small town', Lititz, Pennsylvania. He got his undergraduate degree at the University of Delaware in CS and moved to Corvallis to pursue his doctorate at Oregon State University after graduating. In his thesis, Dr. Hess examined the problem of understanding American football in video using computer vision. Not only has Dr. Hess earned his PhD, he was also an engineer on the Yahoo Machine Learning and Vision team. At Yahoo, Dr. Hess got to research, design, and deploy technologies on a massive scale. Dr. Hess also got to work on Flickr's Front End Team where he implemented and deployed web pages used by millions of people everyday. Wowie! Dr. Hess sure has accomplished quite a bit in his life so far. Currently, Dr. Hess is teaching his third term at Oregon State University. He was inspired to become a professor because he was a teacherâ€™s assistant while he worked on his thesis at OSU and he greatly enjoyed the student-teacher interaction involved with being a TA. He also appreciated being able to help students and aid their understanding.",

    "content": "The favorite movie of Master Hess is a paradox because it is the Matrix: a movie based on Master Hess's life. Prior to teaching at Oregon State University, he was the Chosen One who would bring balance to everything that exists. When offered the chance to take either the blue pill or the red pill, he grabbed Morpheus' hidden secret third arm and chose the green pill, opting instead for ultimate freedom and democracy (which is considered the greatest choice of all). We all have The Captain Hess to thank for saving us from living inside a computer-generated world. ",

Many of these latter classes are not well known to the public but upon inspection (very thorough inspection), one can find said classes within the OSU catalog.

He doesn't enjoy whatever is bad, which is good, instead opting for whatever is good, which is not bad. It's good that he doesn't like bad songs and instead likes not bad songs which are also good not bad but good songs because it's good not bad that he's not into bad not good songs but into good not bad songs instead. A song from his childhood that has stayed near and dear to his heart is Bryan Adams' rendition of the Summer of 69, a delightful classic. ",

Anyone who likes the color red definitely mains Roy on Super Smash Bros, and even though he's a lower tier than some of the popular options such as Marth, Fox, and Meta Knight, Hess has enough fundamentals to dominate in the pro leagues with the best of them. Although he also utilizes Charizard, Ness, and Diddy Kong, he shines most when implementing a full frontal defensive blitzkreig attack strategy with our boy Roy who's our boy. Nothing can withstand the fiery power of his binding blade, especially when he's up against the likes of Pokemon, characters from Fire Emblem, characters from the Mario series, characters from the Metroid series, characters from whatever game Captain Falcon is from, and characters from the rest of the games that I don't remember.
