    In his thesis, Dr. Hess examined the problem of understanding American football in video using computer vision.
    Not only has Dr.Hess earned his PhD, he was also an engineer on the Yahoo Machine Learning and Vision team.
    At Yahoo, Dr.Hess got to research, design, and deploy technologies on a massive scale.
    Dr.Hess also got to work on Flickr's Front End Team where he implemented and deployed web pages used by millions of people everyday.
    Wowie! Dr.Hess sure has accomplished quite a bit in his life so far.
    Currently, Hess is teaching his third term at Oregon State University. He was inspired to become a professor because he was a teacherâ€™s assistant while he worked on his thesis at OSU and
    he greatly enjoyed the student-teacher interaction involved with being a TA. He also appreciated being able to help students and aid their understanding.",
